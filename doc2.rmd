# ORCA

ORCA is a platform for bioinformatics analysis. It is suited for those wishing to conduct self-serve analysis using their own existing data or provides a comprehensive bioinformatics environment for education or research, making results reproducible.

ORCA provides access to a menu of validated bioinformatics software and the power to use these inside a secure and private containerized environment. These private containers are backed by larger mounted storage volumes and dedicated compute nodes to ensure sufficient resources for the demanding needs of bioinformatics analysis.
Hundreds of bioinformatics tools from Homebrew-Science are installed in the ORCA Docker image using [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/), the package manager for Linux. ORCA is based on version 16.04 of Ubuntu Image.

Itâ€™s under the MIT license using the Docker , an open-source platform that 
packages up an application with all of the minimal dependencies it needs.
